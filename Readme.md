# Velocity Loading Limbo
Inpired by the wonderful `LimboReconnect`, this plugin sends the player to a limbo server when a server refuses the connection on an initial login. Once the original server starts up, this plugin will automatically transfer them to it. It basically provides a loading screen while a server is starting instead of just kicking the player like would happen normally.

This is primarily designed for usage with `mc-router`, which will automatically scale up servers on kubernetes when a player tries to connect.
